Here is a list of functions needed for the project. We'll also
need a spreedsheet logging the LM35 output with the diode output.

Main
-Constantly get temperture reading
-Average this reading over a short time
-Output to display

ADC Read
-probes ADC connected to sensor
- 0 to 1024

Temperture Conversion Diode
-Find a model for the relationship of the ADC to temperture
 This is to be done by comparing values to the LM35
-Diode is (Digikey #1N4734AFS-ND)
-We are attempting bias of 100uA 
-Max temp is 80C
-Diode decreases forward voltage drop by 2.5mV per degree.

Temperture Conversion LM35
-Model for the LM35.
-Linear model 10mV/C

Average
- Average temperture readings over short time
- Probably should use values from ADC read to keep uint16 type

LCD Print
- Print the average temperture to the LCD
